# MIPS-2-Cell-Game-of-Life
MIPS implementation of Game Of Life with 2 competing 'species'


- This was a Concepts of COmputer Systems project. It works.
- I don't know what version of rsim we used, i may find out later. The man page wouldn't work and there's no --version cmd line option.
- I was pressed for time so this is a single-file monstrosity. I should have linked multiple files together.
- Debug .word definitions remain in the code. I have no intention of removing them.
- To newcomers of MIPS, you may want to load all supporting files and programs on a pc/vm of Ubuntu.

To build and run!
- run make
- /home/fac/wrc/bin/rsim colony.out
- Type numbers in. There are input restrictions but they're not super strict.


That's it. Have fun. Don't forget to credit me if you use my code.
